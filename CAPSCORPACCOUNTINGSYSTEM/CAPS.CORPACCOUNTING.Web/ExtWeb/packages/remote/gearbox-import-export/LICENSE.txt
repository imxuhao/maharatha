The Software, its source code and the documentation constitute trade secrets and confidential information, which are valuable property of 2Gears and must be held in strict confidence.

Upon any such transfer, the Assignee may appoint new Designated Users.

You acknowledge that this License Agreement is complete and is the exclusive representation of our agreement. No oral or written information given by Us, Our resellers, or otherwise on Our behalf shall create a warranty or collateral contract, or in any way increase the scope of this License Agreement in any way, and You may not rely on any such oral or written information. No term or condition contained in any purchase order shall have any force or effect.

There are no implied licenses or other implied rights granted under this Agreement, and all rights, save for those expressly granted hereunder, shall remain with Us. In addition, no licenses or immunities are granted to the combination of the Software and/or Modifications, as applicable, with any other software or hardware not delivered by Us or Our resellers to You under this Agreement. Your rights under this Agreement apply only to Software, Modifications, and/or Applications for which all Designated Users are duly licensed hereunder.

 

14. MISCELLANEOUS

If any provision in this License Agreement shall be determined to be invalid, such provision shall be deemed omitted; the remainder of this License Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If any remedy provided is determined to have failed for its essential purpose, all limitations of liability and exclusions of damages set forth in this Agreement shall remain in effect.

Regulatory Matters.

The Software is or may be subject to the export control laws of various countries. You agree that you will not submit the Software to any government agency for licensing consideration or other regulatory approval without the 2Gears’ prior written consent and will not export the Software to countries, persons or entities prohibited by such laws. You shall also be responsible for complying with all applicable governmental regulations of the country where You are registered, and any foreign countries with respect to the use of the Software.

This License Agreement may be modified only by a written instrument signed by an authorized representative of each party. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement may not be deemed a waiver of that or any other provision of this Agreement.

All parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Luxembourg and further agree to commence any litigation, which may arise hereunder, in the courts located in Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.
